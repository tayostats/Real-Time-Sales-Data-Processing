# Real-Time-Sales-Data-Processing
A real-time data processing pipeline that ingests streaming sales data from Apache Kafka, parses and aggregates the data using Apache Spark Structured Streaming, and writes the results to a PostgreSQL database. The system supports scalable, fault-tolerant micro-batch processing and enables near real-time analytics on product sales.
